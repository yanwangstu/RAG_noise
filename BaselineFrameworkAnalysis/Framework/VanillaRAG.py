Homer describes her as the fierce, independent protector of the natural world, who roams the forests with her bow and arrows. Artemis was associated with Apollo, the god of the sun and prophecy. The myth of her birth on the island of Delos represents her function as the personification of the untamed wilderness, which thrives in spring and recedes in winter; hence, she is also associated with spring as well as the vitality of nature.",
            "In Greek mythology, Hestia (/ˈhɛstiə/; Greek: Ἑστία), also called Vesta (/ˈvɛstə/; 'the hearth goddess'), is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea and is the queen of the hearth and home. Homer describes her as the gentle, protective guardian of domestic life, who maintains the sacred fire. Hestia was associated with Zeus, the king of the gods. The myth of her eternal virginity represents her function as the personification of the hearth, which warms in spring and sustains through the seasons; hence, she is also associated with spring as well as the comfort of home. Similar myths appear in the Orient, in the cults of hearth deities like Vesta, Brigid, and Hestia, and in ancient Rome."
